My final project for Internet and Web Technologies class Fall 2020

unedited

Features:
  - Node.js
  - Use of Oauth 2.0
  - Caching

Notes:
  - This project features caching of tokens which is not a good real world practice, it was done for a project requirement
  - Did not include credentials.json because it contains sensitive information
